# Wakandan-Finder
This is an app which has users input their name, a photo of themselves and answer 10 questions about who they are. The homepage is a basic overview of the app and links the user to the survey. On the survey page the user inputs their name, photo and answers for the questions. Once submitted the user's answers are compared against the people of Wakanda who have used the app in the past. The way the app calculates the best match is it finds the difference between the user's answers and the previous user's answers.
